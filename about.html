		<h2>Me</h2>
		<p>What up doe! I am Lex. I am from Detroit, MI. I am an avid basketball fan and try to catch women's tennis when I can.</p>
		<p>I write code for a living but I only enjoy it when I spend a substantial amount of time understanding user problems. I used to be an artistic person but I'm slowly getting back to my ways. Iâ€™m developing my radical politic by unlearning behavior everyday.</p>
