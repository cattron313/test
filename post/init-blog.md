What up doe!

This is my blog and this is my first post. This post is really a test run just to make sure I built everything correctly. Yes, I coded this blog using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and I'm proud :)

I created this space primarily for me to work through my thoughts and feelings. I'll probably write about (in no particular order) the tech industry, problems I see in the world that should be solved, my gender, tweets that grind my gears, cool ideas that I have, systemic oppression, and so much more.

So sit back and enjoy the show!
